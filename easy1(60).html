   <div> <p id="reference">
    Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play in the garden. She had a pet rabbit named Snowy. Snowy was soft and fluffy, and Lily loved to cuddle with him.

    One sunny day, Lily and Snowy went for a walk in the park. They saw many colorful flowers and tall trees. They also saw a squirrel climbing up a tree. Lily waved at the squirrel, but it quickly disappeared.
    
    As they walked, they met a friendly old man. He was sitting on a bench, reading a book. Lily and Snowy stopped to say hello. The old man smiled and asked them about their day. Lily told him about her garden and Snowy.
    
    The old man was very kind. He gave Lily a beautiful red balloon. Lily was so happy. She thanked the old man and continued her walk with Snowy. They played in the park until the sun began to set. Then, they went home, tired but happy.
